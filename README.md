**Sustainability Metrics in Supply Chain with Python**

This Python project explores sustainability metrics within supply chain data, offering insights into decision-making parameters. The code utilizes various libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize data.

**Data Source:**

The dataset used for calculating these metrics is obtained from the following link: [Supply Chain Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5).

**Key Features:**

1. **Delivery Time and Late Delivery Rate:** Evaluates average days for shipping, scheduled shipment times, and late delivery rates to assess efficiency and customer satisfaction.

2. **Profitability and Efficiency:** Measures benefit per order, order profit per order, and order item profit ratio to gauge economic sustainability and profitability.

3. **Resource Utilization:** Identifies the customer segment generating the most sales and analyzes order item quantities for demand and inventory management.

4. **Shipping Modes:** Examines the distribution of orders across different shipping modes to identify opportunities for sustainable shipping options.

5. **Geographical Analysis:** Analyzes markets and regions where orders are delivered, helping optimize distribution and reduce transportation emissions.

6. **Order Status Analysis:** Measures the distribution of order statuses to identify trends related to order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.

**Note:** Sustainability is a multi-dimensional concept, and the metrics provided may need to align with your organization's goals and priorities.

The project can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making within supply chain management, including the implementation of machine learning algorithms for route optimization based on specific criteria. I am currently working on more advanced applications like route optimization, geographic data, and visualization, additional libraries such as scikit-learn, NetworkX, OR-Tools, and Folium. I will update the code in here. 

*Note: Ensure the availability of the required datasets and proper data paths for successful execution.*
